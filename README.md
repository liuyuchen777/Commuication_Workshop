# Commuication_Workshop
Use C language to simulate basic concept in communication

Why use C to simulate?

I don't know ...

## some feedback 2020.11.24

I heard someone got wronh result with same code. I think is the problem of working environment.

My work environmeny is: vscode (just as text editor) + wsl + gcc99 and use makefile to compile.

## how to use this program

for makefile

```shell
make
./main <note>
```

for cmake

```shell
cmake ..
make
./<project> <note>
```

## add C++ and Python version of code from Workshop 4

C++ complete supported Complex class
